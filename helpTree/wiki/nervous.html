  <h1>Feeling Anxious, Worried, or Scared?</h1>
  <br>
  <p>Nervous feelings can feel overwhelming and it's very easy to get wrapped up in them, however, there are things that can help. Sometimes there are things you can proactively do to ease your nerves and be better prepared or ok with whatever's going on.</p>
  <br>
  <p>This may not work for everyone, but thinking about what's making you anxious can sometimes help you work out whatever's behind the negative feelings and come up with solutions. Other times, however, there is no clear way to alleviate some of the feeling through thought, but other things can help.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Deep breathing is often one of the first things you hear when talking about managing negative emotions, but it really does help. Take some deep breaths and try to clear your head as best as you can. Next, think of some steps you can take to aid in your situation. Maybe thats getting some small tasks done, talking to someone about how you're feeling, or if you're worried about something coming up in the future, take steps to prepare for it. </p>
  <br>
  <p>These techniques may not work 100% of the time, as nerves and stress have many differnet causes, some more difficult than others, but just remember that whatever's going on right now will pass, and there are people around that will be there to support you if you need.</p>
