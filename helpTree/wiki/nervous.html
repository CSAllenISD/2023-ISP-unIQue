	  <h1>Deep Breathing</h1>
	  <div class="row">
	    <div class="small-col">
  <p>Deep breathing is one of the proven most effective ways of managing your emotions and generally feeling a little bit more at peace.</p>
  <p>Start by finding a comfortable and quiet place wherever you are. If this isn't possible, try your best to tune out your surroundings and focus on yourself and how you're feeling</p>
  <p>Take a big deep breath, filling up your lungs completely, focusing on the feeling.</p>
  <p>Now slowly count to three, or however long is most comfortable for you, holding the air in.</p>
  <p>Exhale slowly and evenly, releasing all the tension in your body. Imagine that you're letting go of all that worry.</p>
  <p>You can repeat this as many times as you want or until you're feeling better. If you feel yourself in pain or getting lightheaded, stop immediately and breathe normally. Only do what your body can handle and is comfortable with.</p>

	  <h1>Meditation</h1>
	  <div class="row">
	    <div class="small-col">
  <p>Meditation can go hand in hand with deep breathing, but its more effective if you are alone or in a quiet place where you can be uninterrupted for a bit</p>
  <p>This process is different for anyone, but one way to start could be by putting some relaxing music or white noise {LINK TO WHITE NOISE} on in the background.</p>
  <p>Relax your body, a lot of times sitting cross-legged on the floor with your back straight can be a good position, although wherever you feel comfortable works too.</p>
  <p>Now focus on your breathing. You can just be breathing normally for this, but pay attention to how it makes you feel and the sensations of it.</p>
  <p>The trick to effective meditation is to not worry about "calming your mind". Instead, if your mind starts to wander, acknowledge it before guiding your thoughts back to your breathing.</p>
  <p>You can do this for as long as you want, setting a timer for a few minutes to start with can be a good idea, but any time at all spent meditating is time well spent.</p>

		<h1>Grounding</h1>
		<div class="row">
		  <div class="small-col">
		    <p>In times of distress or extreme worry, grounding techniques can be especially useful. One of these is the 5-4-3-2-1 method and it helps to connect you in the present moment.</p>
  <p>Name 5 things you can see. Take a moment to look around your environment and say out loud, or note in your mind, five specific things that you can see.</p>
  <p>Name 4 things you can feel. This could be your clothing, the ground, something you're sitting on, or anything else you can feel in the present moment.</p>
  <p>Name 3 things you can hear. Maybe its a fan, outside noises, or anything else, but really take a minute and listen to your surroundings, truly noticing them.</p>
  <p>Name 2 things you can smell. If you can't smell anything at first, try finding something around you that you can. If you are unable to find anything, imagine your favorite scents instead.</p>
  <p>Name 1 thing you can taste. This could be the aftertaste of something you may have eaten, but if you can't taste anything, imagine your favorite tastes instead.</p>
  <p>Once you've completed this, end by taking a few deep breaths and pull yourself back into the present moment.</p>
