  <p>Sadness can make you feel helpless and alone, and it can be hard to navigate. To start, know that your emotions are completely valid and it's totally okay to feel sad.</p>
  <br>
  <p>The first step to feeling b etter is accepting your emotions, rather than supressing what you're feeling. Try identifying the source of your emotion, and understand why it's making you feel that way.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Next, try talking to a close friend or family member. You are not a burden for asking for help from those who love you. Talking to someone can help you process your situation, or gain a fresh perspective on it.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Even though it can be hard, it's also extremely important to continue to take care of yourself. Get enough rest and do things you enjoy. Making sure your body is healthy can be enough to make you feel emotionally rejuvenated.</p>
