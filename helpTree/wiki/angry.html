  <h1>Feeling Annoyed, Mad, or Outraged?</h1>
  
  <p>Feeling upset and angry is never a good feeling. Whether its directed at an authority figure, peers, or even yourself, there are things you can do to help manage your feelings.</p>
  <br>
  <p>It may sound chliche but taking a couple deep breaths can be very beneficial. Additionally, grabbing a healthy snack, putting on more comfortable clothes, or even taking a shower can make you feel better and clear your mind.</p>
  <br>
  <p>After you've calmed down a bit, try to pinpoint exactly why you're upset. This may be difficult, but just allow yourself to feel whatever you're feeling without judging yourself for it and see where that takes you.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Remember that what you're feeling is completely valid, but when reacting to these things, make sure to be conscious of how your reactions affect others. Blowing up at a friend or loved one because of a bad mood is rarely a good experience. It may be hard, but communicating your feelings as calmly as possible will help those around you better understand how they can help you. </p>
